dc.files.kbd
============

This is my Keyboard Layout, which I've spent a considerable amount of time refining.  This project is part of my dotfiles, which can be found at http://github.com/dcunited001/dc.files.  This project also includes my keybindings for zsh, vim, emacs and pretty much any other program.  I put them all in one repo so they could be easily shared as a complete profile.

> On OSX: you will need to install KeyRemap4MacBook, PCKeyboardHack, and NoEjectDelay.  
> They are all free and have awesome default settings, regardless of whether you add my private.xml settings.

### To Install:
- Install KeyRemap4MacBook, PCKeyboardHack, and NoEjectDelay.
- Restart your computer multiple times!
- Copy the contents of the KeyRemap4MacBook folder to "~/Library/Application Support/KeyRemap4MacBook"
- Now that my custom settings are available in KeyRemap4MacBook, choose the ones you like and enable them.

> Note: some settings may clash with others.  If you run into problems, give me a shout.  And this is a work in progress, so it's not polished.

### TODO:
- Switch to a DVORAK layout.  Hopefully soon, but I don't want to cross my fingers...
- Figure out what to do with Shift+Digits and Shift+Consumer.
- Move the Consumer Keys (play/pause/etc) from Uber+Consumer to Shift+Consumer?
- Swap ` and ~
- Find a better location for |
- Application-Specific/Language-Specific Keys?
